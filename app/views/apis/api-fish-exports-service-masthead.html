            <h2 class="govuk-heading govuk-heading-m" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">You must create a catch certificate to export a consignment of fish that has been landed into the UK by a UK flagged catching vessel. A catch certificate shows that you’ve caught your fish legally. Catch certificates are required for movements of fish from:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Great Britain to Northern Ireland</li>

            <p class="govuk-body">This API enables system-to-system calls between your own software and the Fish Exports Service. This makes it easier to apply for a catch certificate and reduces the admin burden on exporters. It also reduces the risk of errors and data entry duplication.</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullets">
              <li>retrieve lists of valid catch areas and departure countries</li>
              <li>check a vessel is eligible to create a catch certificate</li>
              <li>search valid product species, preservation and presentation methods for creating catch certificates
