    <p class="govuk-body">To make sure all export data is consistent with the EU’s trade and control expert system (TRACES), we have made some changes to how you apply for an export health certificate (EHC).</p>
    <p>If data is consistent between exporters in Great Britain and importers in Northern Ireland and the EU, exports are more likely to pass through border control posts and reach their destinations on time.
    <p>Certifiers and importers will no longer need to use paper copies of EHCs.</p>
    <p>Before you submit your application to the certifier, you’ll need to enter or upload data for the export’s commodity group, weight and quantity. This data will be validated by TRACES before you submit the application to the certifier.</p>
    <p>You can still <a href="#">use the previous EHC application service</a> if you want to:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>view an application that you started before <strong>1 September 2022</strong></li>
      <li>apply for an EHC for exports to countries outside the EU or Northern Ireland</li>
    </ul>
